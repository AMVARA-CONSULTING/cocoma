Features yet to be implemented for CoCoMa
=========================================

- Compare currently set values on the server with those configured in the config
file to show any differences. By this means manipulations, that have been made
by any users with sufficient rights can be found easily - and reverted if
desired.

- Add a list of all secured functions and secured features to the code, so that
it can be checked if the capabilities defined in the config file actually 
reference existing objects.

- Add a version check of the addressed C8 server and the Cognos SDK used for the
implementation. Still to be checked if this is possible at all.
